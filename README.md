# sample_dataset

This is a sample dataset for the ABCD-ReproNim course to accompany the week 5 quiz on FAIR data.

The materials for this lesson can be found [here](https://abcd-repronim.github.io/materials/week-5)

The exercises can be found at [here](https://github.com/ABCD-ReproNim/exercises).

**NOTE**: All raw data NIFTI files are empty. The purpose of this sample dataset is to gain experience with the [BIDS specification](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), not for any actual data analysis. In practice, data and datasets should not be stored on GitHub.

No acutal data were harmed in the making of this dataset (e.g. all data in this repository are fabricated and for educational purposes only)
